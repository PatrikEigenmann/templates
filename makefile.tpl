# makefile for the tool pmake. pmake is a tool that reads instructions you give it about how to
# use a compiler of your choice and then automatically runs the compiler to build your software
# projects. Imagine it as a smart assistant that knows exactly how to compile and prepare all
# the pieces of your software, ensuring everything fits together correctly without you having to
# manually run each step. This automation makes the development process faster and reduces the
# chance of errors.

# The compiler used for compiling the project is essential. Commonly, GCC is employed for Windows
# due to its robustness and prevalence in open-source development. On MacOS, Clang is preferred
# for its speed and advanced diagnostics. These compilers translate source code into executable
# binaries, ensuring compatibility and optimized performance across different operating systems.

# If the project requires specific compiler flags for compilation, these flags should be specified
# to ensure the code is compiled correctly and efficiently. Compiler flags can enable or disable
# features, optimize performance, or enforce coding standards. Properly setting and documenting
# these flags can lead to more robust and optimized software, improving performance and catching
# potential errors during compilation. While optional, using the right flags is crucial for
# consistency and reproducibility in the build process.

# If the project necessitates specific compiler flags for compilation, these should be meticulously
# specified to ensure precise and efficient code compilation. Compiler flags play a crucial role in
# enabling or disabling features, optimizing performance, and enforcing strict coding standards.
# Properly documenting and utilizing these flags can enhance the robustness and optimization of the
# software, ensuring consistency and reducing potential errors in the build process. Although optional,
# their strategic use is pivotal for achieving high-quality, reliable software development.

# Specify the project name, as pmake will use this name to create the executable. If the src directive
# is not specified, pmake assumes the corresponding .c file has the same name as the project directive.
# This automatic association streamlines the build process by aligning the project name with its main 
# source file when no specific source files are defined.

# The `src` directive specifies the source files that require compilation. If the `src` directive is
# left empty, `pmake` assumes that the corresponding `.c` file shares the same name as the project
# directive. This automatic association streamlines the build process by aligning the project name
# with its main source file when no specific source files are defined.

# Specify the libraries, either as .c source files or already compiled .o object files. Ensure these
# files are properly included in the build process to guarantee successful compilation and linking
