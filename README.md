# Template Repository

Welcome to the Template Repository! This project contains a collection of templates designed to make
the start in any programming language easy and efficient. Templates are with header information, basic
includes or imports and standard version control. The bash script cdget.sh or batch script cdget.cmd are
the scripts to use to copy a template in the active folder.
